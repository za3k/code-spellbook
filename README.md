This is a spellbook of computer programs.

- Each program is written on 80 column x 25 row pages. (1 page, if possible!)
- Programs operate Unix-style, on stdin and stdout. 
- Programs also have a function interface.
- Programs are in the public domain
- Programs are written in C with no library dependencies
- Programs are "minified" (no whitespace, one letter variables) to reduce space
- The goal is that someone could write a simple C compiler to run this code.
  Therefore, the C used is simple (no macros, casting, postfix operators).
  To help reader comprehension, programs prefer arrays over pointer arithmetic.

If you want to add a new program, feel free.

Modifications to existing programs are accepted when they improve readability
without increasing page count, or if they reduce page count.
